# Checker - Svelte
Checkers is a classic board game made with the Svelte framework. It features intuitive controls, allowing you to easily show possible moves, move pieces, and capture your opponent's pieces. The game is fast-paced and exciting, with a simple yet challenging strategy.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
